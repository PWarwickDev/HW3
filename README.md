Project Description: Used Html, CSS, and JS to design a webpage with a dynamic multiplication table.

General Structure: index.html is styled by style.css, and made dynamic by script.js

Requirement Fulfillment:

    - My website includes a dynamic and aesthetic table which ranges with input numbers of -50 to 50 
    for both the multipliers and multiplicands.
    - The table is styled by way of gradient logic found through cell rows and columns. This leads to a nice looking
    yet still readable table, especially at higher ranges it looks good.
    - Table is scrollable when the table is too big for the screen.
    - Errors are dealt with gracefully, with no popups and it displays error messages under the forms.
    - Input is checked before table creation, nothing other than numbers are allowed.
    - Table results are correct.
    - Files are detailed with comments, and formatted well.

    Based on these facts, I believe I have fulfilled all requirements for this assignment.
